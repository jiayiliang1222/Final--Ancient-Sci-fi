    <a id="line1">The alien finally comes. He conquers all of Earth, but only on a small scale. After establishing an army of soldiers, he
        has already established a pattern for his invasion force to follow. Of course, his army will be much smaller, probably only a hundred or so men. But his army will not be so small that it is impossible to eliminate them.
        Thus, we must build a force of ten thousand soldiers. Before the second wave of the aliens arrives, it is probably best to build a battery of cannons on artificial islands, which can then be fired at the landing strips.
        Once the landing strips have been attacked, they are destroyed.”
