      <br>  SunTzu:"The good fighter will be able to secure himself against defeat, but the fighter who is destined to defeat first needs to be able to secure himself against defeat. Therefore the good fighter will be able to defeat the alien without suffering a defeat.
      <br>  Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.

     <br>   One bad general is worth two good ones.
