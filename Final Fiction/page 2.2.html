    <a id="line1">To face this new strange guest, people turn to the oldest and the brightest minds for help. 
      <br>  The Official:"Masters, how should we fight with the alien?"
     <br> SunTzu:"Light your fire and consume your prey. Do not stir forth from beneath your feet. Do not attack from below.
     <br> An army may march forth from without, but a guide will be needed to bring it into being.
     <br> The next best is to let the alien know of your intention, and to refrain from fighting even though the alien be unaware of it.
    <br>  The next in the line of troops is stationary rank, but a pilot will be needed to bring the alien to the front."</a>


    <a id="line2">Napoleon:"If you wage war, do it energetically and with severity. This is the only way to make it shorter and consequently less inhuman.
    <br>  An army's effectiveness depends on its size, training, experience, and morale, and morale is worth more than any of the other factors combined.
    <br>  In time of revolution, with perseverance and courage, a soldier should think nothing impossible.
    <br>  Every means should be taken to attach the soldier to his colours.
    <br>  War is 90% information."
