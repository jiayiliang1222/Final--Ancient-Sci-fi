The alien is coming to earth. He’s going to destroy the human world.”
    “Stop the clock!” The man was a bit annoyed. “Are you saying that the alien will come to Earth?”
   “Stop the clock!”
   “In reality, the clock will stop just as soon as the human world is about to be destroyed.”
The clock waved at the alien. “Stop the clock!�...
To face this new strange guest, people turn to the oldest and the brightest minds for help. 
The Official:"Masters, how should we fight with the alien?"
SunTzu:"The good fighter will be able to secure himself against defeat, but the fighter who is destined to defeat first needs to be able to secure himself against defeat. Therefore the good fighter will be able to defeat the alien without suffering a defeat.
Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.
Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the alien means taking the offensive.

Napoleon:"The basic principle that we must follow in directing the armies of the Republic is this: that they must feed themselves on war at the expense of the alien territory.
The allies we gain by victory will turn against us upon the bare whisper of our defeat.
One bad general is worth two good ones.

Napoleon:"The fate of a Nation may sometimes depend upon the position of a fortress.
An Emperor confides in national soldiers, not in mercenaries.

War must be made as intense and awful as possible in order to make it short, and thus to diminish its horrors.
War is..."
The alien finally comes. The soldiers surround the Emperor with its coils wrapped around steel posts and the rakes of spears used to poke holes in the walls. They tear open the gates of the fortress like giant drapes, and the Emperor is taken back into the darkness of space.
Behind them, the night sky bore a menacing, ominous crescendo. The ground glowed with a faint red light that could be seen from a few hundred meters away.
Around them, the stars glowed with a silvery glow similar to the cyan moon in the morning, and soon the entire sky was covered by the glowing crescendos.
