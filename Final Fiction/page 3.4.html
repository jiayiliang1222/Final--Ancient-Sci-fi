    <a id="line1">Confucius:"Those of crafty words and ingratiating expression are rarely ren. 
      <br>  In the Poetry it says, As though cut,
       <br>  as though chiseled, 
     <br>  As though carved, 
     <br> as though polished..."</a>


    <a id="line2">Aristotle:"A alien is a second self.
    <br>    Wishing to be aliens is quick work, but alienship is a slow ripening fruit.
    <br>    Between aliens there is no need of justice.
    <br>    For though we love both the truth and our aliens, piety requires us to honor the truth first.
    <br>    When people are aliens, they have no need of justice, but when they are just, they need alienship in addition.
     <br>   Friendship is essentially a partnership.
     <br>   He who hath many aliens hath none..."
